<p>Hello and welcome, my name is Ariel and Iâ€™m a Chilean â€˜designerâ€™ who in 2018 left everything behind to move to <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aotearoa">white cloud country</a>, New Zealand.</p>

<p>Professionally Iâ€™ve been working for more than 8 years in design focused on digital, video editing, but mainly in web development where Iâ€™ve had the pleasure to collaborate with great teams in a variety of industries. If you want you can check my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arielcerdahernandez/">linkedin</a> or check my <a href="https://arielcerda.com/portfolio">portfolio</a>.</p>

<p>My favourite tools are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For designing <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a></li>
  <li>To write code <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a></li>
  <li>Favorite framework <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwindcss</a></li>
  <li>to edit videos <a href="https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/">Final Cut Pro</a></li>
  <li>To organize my life <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion.so</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="but-life-isnt-all-work-is-it">But life isnâ€™t all work, is it?</h3>

<p>Among the many hobbies I have, I enjoy spending my free time playing video games, watching good movies, hanging out with friends and when inspiration strikes I like to make videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWip2TrjNMXb0kg6LWbsNzw?sub_confirmation=1">YouTube</a> sharing my experience of what itâ€™s like to live abroad.</p>

<p>If you have questions, send me a message on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/smilesharks/">Instagram</a>, and Iâ€™ll be happy to answer you, but you have to be patient because New Zealand is in the future and messages take a while to arrive.</p>

<h3 id="about-the-blog">About the blog</h3>
