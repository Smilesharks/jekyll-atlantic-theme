## A little about me

Hello and welcome, my name is Ariel and I'm a Chilean 'designer' who in 2018 left everything behind to move to [white cloud country](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aotearoa), New Zealand.

Professionally I've been working for more than 8 years in design focused on digital, video editing, but mainly in web development where I've had the pleasure to collaborate with great teams in a variety of industries. If you want you can check my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arielcerdahernandez/) or check my [portfolio](https://arielcerda.com/portfolio).

My favourite tools are:

- For designing [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
- To write code [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Favorite framework [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- to edit videos [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/)
- To organize my life [Notion.so](https://www.notion.so/)

### But life isn't all work, is it?

Among the many hobbies I have, I enjoy spending my free time playing video games, watching good movies, hanging out with friends and when inspiration strikes I like to make videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWip2TrjNMXb0kg6LWbsNzw?sub_confirmation=1) sharing my experience of what it's like to live abroad.

If you have questions, send me a message on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/smilesharks/), and I'll be happy to answer you, but you have to be patient because New Zealand is in the future and messages take a while to arrive.

### About the blog

The purpose of this blog is to document and share my experiences and experiment.

It was created using free technology:

For hosting the site I use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

For the development [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) 4.1+ [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) v3.0+ [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) 8.4+
and the structure is based on the **[Jekyll Atlantic](https://github.com/zerostaticthemes/jekyll-atlantic-theme)** theme that I then customized.

This is version number 4.4 of the blog you can check the code in [Github](https://github.com/Smilesharks/jekyll-atlantic-theme)
